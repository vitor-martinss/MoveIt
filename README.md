## 💇🏻‍♂️ About the project

This project is an web application of time management.
It helps developers or any person who wants to apply the Pomodoro Technique to their daily basis.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
